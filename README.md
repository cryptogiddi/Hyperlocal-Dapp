# Hyperlocal-Dapp

The “Hyperlocal Dapp” delivery model is a platform established for the local merchants to trade their goods online where customers can order from them while riders will be used to deliver the good. All types of goods ranging from groceries, electronics, medicines and others will be available on the platform and on-demand deliveries made upon ordering through the help of riders within minutes.
The development will entail the deep logic of the decentralized application, the smart contracts, data processing mechanisms, component integration and performance, and so on.
